/**
 * useGoalActive — whether the current session has an active /goal context.
 *
 * Why a hook (vs. a plain getter):
 *   GeminiClient.activeGoalContext is plain in-memory state, not React
 *   state. Setting / clearing it (via useGoalWizard or the /goal clear
 *   command) does NOT trigger App.tsx to re-render. We need the bottom
 *   status bar to flip between the GoalActiveIndicator and the
 *   YOLO/AUTO_EDIT indicator within a second of the user's action — so
 *   we install a 1-Hz heartbeat that polls the client.
 *
 *   1Hz is plenty: goal start/clear are coarse events, and any
 *   sub-second flicker would be noise. Same cadence as
 *   GoalActiveIndicator's elapsed-counter heartbeat — they don't share
 *   the timer to keep concerns isolated and to avoid one being torn
 *   down before the other.
 *
 * Returns boolean only; if you need the goal context object itself,
 * read it directly from `config.getGeminiClient().getGoalContext()`
 * inside the consuming component (also re-evaluated each render).
