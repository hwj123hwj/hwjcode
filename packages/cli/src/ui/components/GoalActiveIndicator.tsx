/**
 * GoalActiveIndicator — bottom-status-bar indicator shown while /goal mode
 * is active.
 *
 * Replaces the YOLO/AUTO_EDIT indicator while goal is running, because
 * /goal force-enables YOLO mode anyway — showing "YOLO mode (ctrl+y)" in
 * that state would be redundant and would hide the more important fact
 * that an autonomous long-running task is in progress.
 *
 * ## Pause-on-idle behavior
 *
 * The elapsed counter is intentionally paused while the agent is idle
 * (i.e. `streamingState === Idle`):
 *
 *   - When idle, we DO NOT install the 1-Hz heartbeat — no setInterval,
 *     no re-render, no Date.now() reads. The displayed elapsed value
 *     freezes at whatever was shown the moment idle started.
 *   - When the user sends a new message and the agent resumes
 *     (Responding / WaitingForConfirmation), the heartbeat restarts and
 *     the counter jumps to "now − T0" — which naturally accounts for the
 *     wall-clock time that passed during idle. We are NOT trying to show
 *     "active time only"; we just stop redrawing while there's no agent
 *     activity to reflect.
 *
 * Why not "active time only" semantics?
 *   The /goal contract gives the model a wall-clock elapsed = now − T0
 *   (the model verifies via local_time). Changing the indicator to show
 *   accumulated-active time would desync the user-visible counter from
 *   what the model itself computes. Pausing redraws (without changing
 *   the math) keeps both views consistent: when the agent next computes
 *   elapsed, the indicator immediately catches up.
 *
 * Why pause redraws at all?
 *   Idle is normally just "waiting for user input" — re-rendering this
 *   tiny element once a second is cheap, but Ink redraws the full
 *   bottom-bar row, which causes terminal flicker on slow connections
 *   and wastes cycles. Stopping the heartbeat eliminates that.
 *
 * Heartbeat (when active):
 *   The goal context lives inside GeminiClient as a plain in-memory field
 *   (GeminiClient.activeGoalContext) — not React state — so React has no
 *   way to know when its `startedAt` advances into a new "elapsed = N
 *   seconds" tick. We force a re-render once per second via a local
 *   `tick` state. Same pattern LoadingIndicator uses for its elapsed
 *   counter.
