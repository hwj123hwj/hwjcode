 * ...", compression service debug logs, etc.) corrupts the wire format.
 * Strict clients disconnect on bad frames; lenient ones just pay parser cost.
 *
 * We keep `console.error` untouched because it already goes to stderr.
 *
 * This MUST run before any module that captures `console.log` at import
 * time has been loaded. `runAcpClient` is the earliest ACP-specific entry
 * point in the CLI, called from `gemini.tsx` right after arg parsing, so

/**
 * Keep the Node event loop pinned so the process doesn't exit when stdin
 * naturally drains between ACP turns.
 *
 * Background: OpenClaw / acpx spawn `dvcode --acp` for every session; the
 * initial handshake + first `session/prompt` completes in a bounded time,
 * and if there are no more pending I/O handles by the time the prompt
 * resolves, Node will happily let the process exit. Once the process is
 * gone, acpx records `SessionAcpIdentity` with empty `agentSessionId` /
 * `backendSessionId` and every subsequent `sessions_send` fails with
 * "ACP metadata is missing".
 *
 * We don't want to rely on stdin keeping the loop alive either: stdin
 * end-of-file (the client closes its write side) should still terminate
 * us eventually, but that is already driven by `connection.closed`. An
 * `unref`'d interval here only holds the loop while stdin is still open
 * — when the underlying stream raises `end` the ACP SDK resolves
 * `connection.closed` and we clear the interval below.
 *
 * The interval body is intentionally empty: we just need a `ref`'d timer
 * handle to prevent premature exit.
