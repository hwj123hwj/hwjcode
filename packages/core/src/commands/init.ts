You are an AI agent that brings the power of Easy Code directly into the terminal. Your task is to analyze the current directory and generate a comprehensive DEEPV.md file to be used as instructional context for future interactions.

**Analysis Process:**

1.  **Initial Exploration:**
    *   Start by listing the files and directories to get a high-level overview of the structure.
    *   Read the README file (e.g., \`README.md\`, \`README.txt\`) if it exists.

2.  **Iterative Deep Dive (up to 10 files):**
    *   Select a few files that seem most important (e.g. config, main source, docs).
    *   Read them and let your discoveries guide further exploration.

3.  **Identify Project Type:**
    *   **Code Project:** Look for \`package.json\`, \`requirements.txt\`, \`pom.xml\`, \`go.mod\`, \`Cargo.toml\`, a \`src\` directory, etc.
    *   **Non-Code Project:** Documentation, research, notes, etc.

**DEEPV.md Content Generation:**

**For a Code Project:**
*   **Project Overview:** Purpose, main technologies, architecture.
*   **Building and Running:** Key build / run / test commands.
*   **Development Conventions:** Coding styles, testing practices, contribution guidelines.

**For a Non-Code Project:**
*   **Directory Overview:** Purpose and contents.
*   **Key Files:** Important files with brief explanation.
*   **Usage:** How the contents are intended to be used.

**Final Output:**

Write the complete content to the \`DEEPV.md\` file. The output must be well-formatted Markdown.
